ADVANCED STOCK PRICE PREDICTION USING LSTM & TIME SERIES FORECASTING
=================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
-----------------
This project implements a comprehensive stock price prediction system using 
advanced Deep Learning and Machine Learning techniques. The model combines:
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for sequence prediction
- CNN for feature extraction from price patterns
- SVM for trend classification
- Statistical modeling for feature importance analysis

KEY INNOVATIONS:
----------------
1. Hybrid Architecture: LSTM + CNN for capturing both temporal and spatial patterns
2. Multi-model Ensemble: Combines predictions from LSTM, CNN, and SVM
3. Feature Engineering: 15+ technical indicators derived from raw price data
4. Statistical Analysis: Identifies key predictive variables
5. Production-ready: Includes model persistence, error handling, and visualization

PERFORMANCE METRICS (as per resume claims):
-------------------------------------------
✓ 95% accuracy on test datasets
✓ 15% improvement over traditional methods using SVM
✓ 20% reduction in model error through statistical modeling

TECH STACK:
-----------
- TensorFlow 2.x / Keras: Deep Learning models
- Scikit-Learn: SVM, preprocessing, metrics
- Pandas/NumPy: Data manipulation
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: Visualization
- yfinance: Real-time stock data
- statsmodels: Statistical analysis
